- **Optimize Monitor Placement:** Users can select the optimal number of monitors, adjust their coverage radius, and prioritize specific habitat types for conservation efforts.
- **Interactive User Interface:** The web application provides an interactive interface for users to explore different monitor placement scenarios and understand their impact on habitat coverage.
