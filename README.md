# Interactive Habitat Monitoring Map with Bokeh

This project leverages the Bokeh library to create an interactive web application for visualizing and optimizing the placement of environmental monitors in the Pirbright Range. It is designed to assist environmental scientists and conservationists in strategically deploying monitors to efficiently cover different habitat types.

## Features

- **Visualize Different Habitats:** Display various habitat types within the Pirbright Range using an interactive map.
- **Optimize Monitor Placement:** Users can select the optimal number of monitors, adjust their coverage radius, and prioritize specific habitat types for conservation efforts.
- **Interactive User Interface:** The web application provides an interactive interface for users to explore different monitor placement scenarios and understand their impact on habitat coverage.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Bokeh
- Pandas
- GeoPandas
- NumPy
- Requests (if needed for external data fetching)

These packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bokeh pandas geopandas numpy requests
